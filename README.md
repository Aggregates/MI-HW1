COMP3330 - Machine Intelligence
===============================

# Abstract #

This project aims to research several training tasks associated with machine learning, including:

* The Two Spirals Task and variations of
* The Autoencoder, using a sparse coding
* The Classification for Human Activity Recognition

# Developer Notes #

1. Download pybuilder (this project's build tool) `pip install pybuilder`
2. Install a markdown editor (Preferably one with a table generator)

# Project Dependencies #

* pybrain
* numpy
* matplotlib
* libsvm (included)

# Running PyBuilder #

1. Once pybuilder is installed, it will be placed in your system's python/scripts location as pyb or pyb_
2. Run ``pyb`` (or ``pyb_``) to build the project
3. Run ``pyb install_dependencies`` to manually download the dependencies for the project (This should be done automatically when you run ``pyb`` )
